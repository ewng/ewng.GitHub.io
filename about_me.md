I'm Molly, a PhD student within the Disease Dynamics Unit of the University of Cambridge, supervised by Professor Caroline Trotter. Within my PhD I am currently aiming to build a predictive geographic model that can estimate the risk of meningitis outbreaks across Africa based on temporal climate variables. 

Before beginning my PhD I completed a BSc in Biomedical Science at the University of Kent and an MSc in Tropical Disease Biology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. I previously worked as an Epidemiology and Information Analyst within the UK Health Security Agency Field Service on a variety of communicable disease outbreaks. Through this work, I led a research project on at-risk groups for late HIV diagnosis. Whilst at UKHSA I undertook a secondment with the WHO working as a GOARN epidemiologist on the MPox outbreak within Europe.

Outside of work I love rock climbing, making art and listening to music :)
